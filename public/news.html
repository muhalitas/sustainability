					<h2>1- Pursuit of Sustainability: The S3-Lab's Directors' Note on the Cities of the Future-H2020- October 1st, 2016</h2>
Drs. Murat Kucukvar and Nuri C. Onat participated a recent international brokerage event organized by the “Turkey In Horizon 2020” project and TUBITAK National Coordination Office for the European Union (EU) Framework Programmes. The “Cities of the Future 2016” Brokerage Event brought together 300 researchers, industry professionals, government officials and policy makers from Europe and Turkey. The event will target the following the EU’s Horizon 2020 project calls: ‘Smart and Sustainable Cities’ and ‘Energy Efficient Buildings’, ‘Sustainable Process Industries’ and ‘Circular Economy, ‘The European Green Vehicles Initiative’, and ‘Factories of The Future’. 

<p>Drs. Nuri Onat and Murat Kucukvar represented S3-Lab in the bilateral meetings. The event provided an excellent platform to expand S3-Lab’s network and paved the way for new partnership opportunities for the upcoming calls in Horizon 2020. </p>

<p><a name="battery"> In bilateral meetings, S3-Lab directors made important connections from industry, researchers, and policy makers within and beyond Turkey. They discussed various sustainability solutions for the socio-economic and environmental issues related by bridging the academia and industry.</a> </p>

					<h2>2-Dr. Onat Met with the CEO of Battery Switchy Inc. Targeting the EU Horizon 2020 Innovation Action Project Calls-October 10th, 2016 </h2>

					<p>Electric mobility offers a paradigm shift towards an energy-efficient, decarbonized, and environmentally friendly transport sector. Electricity as an energy source for transportation provides opportunities to substitute oil with a wide range of primary energy sources, which could help to decrease the European Union (EU)’s oil dependency (highest in the world with 90% oil import in 2014) and a broader use of renewable and carbon-free energy sources in the transport sector, helping the EU’s CO2 emissions reduction targets. In response to concerns associated with energy security and environmental issues, the EU, under Horizon 2020, is ramping up investment (close to €6 billion) in energy research and innovation including green vehicles, energy storage, and smart grids/cities. The EU Commission highlights that "Europe needs to speed up electrification of its car fleet and other means of transport and become a leader in electro-mobility". The development of “Smart, Green, and Integrated Transport” is a major challenge for Europe and requires comprehensive research, cross-sectorial collaborations involving governments, automotive industry, and society.</p>
					
					<p>In this regard, S3-Lab’s Co-director, Dr. Nuri Onat met with various industry stakeholders targeting the EU Horizon 2020 project calls in a recent international brokerage event organized by the “Turkey In Horizon 2020” project. The “Cities of the Future 2016” Brokerage Event brought together international companies working on issues related to “Smart, Green, and Integrated Transport” and S3-Lab.</p>

					<p><a name="cpet"> One of the companies S3-Lab made connection is Battery Switchy Ltd. (BSL), which has developed powerful batteries and batteries swapping kiosks for the SMART CITY light electric vehicles such as e-scooters and fast e-scooters. They aim to eliminate the Range Anxiety associated with electric vehicles, thus providing the riders a sense of freedom. The CEO, of BSL, Dr. Meir Teichner and Drs. Nuri Onat and Murat Kucukvar exchanged important ideas and in the process of negation for establishing a consortium project to be submitted to the Horizon 2020 project calls. </a></p>

					<h2>3-Dr. Kucukvar attended to the Collaborative Programme Euphrates and Tigris (CPET) Socioeconomic and Energy Task Force Meetings in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia on September 26-29, 2016. </h2>

					<p>Together with the Turkish Water Institute, supported by the Turkish Ministry of Forestry and Water Affairs, Dr. Murat Kucukvar works for the CPET’s socioeconomic and energy systems analysis task forces as a member of Turkish national delegation. </p>
					
					<p>The CPET works for cooperation among the Euphrates and Tigris basin countries through increased access to information and knowledge transfer regarding water management. The CPET is implemented by several partners including Stockholm International Water Institute, Stockholm Environment Institute, Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, Turkish Water Institute and International Center for Biosaline Agriculture.</p>

					<p> Dr. Kucukvar attended the 3rd task force meetings on September 26-29, 2016 in Kuala Lumpur. He discussed the environmental and socioeconomic impacts in the Euphrates and Tigris region related to agricultural and renewable energy investment (mainly hydropower and solar) plans. </p>

					<p><a name="metropol">The 3rd task force meeting concluded that there is dire need on the regional collaboration, development of scientific methods and multi-objective decision support tools to guide policy makers toward exploring the environmental and socioeconomic impacts on the region associated with the use of TE’s water for energy and agricultural investment strategies.</a></p>

					<h2>4-The Metropolitan Istanbul is getting Thirstier! </h2>

					<p>The S3-Lab’s co-director Asst. Prof. Dr. Murat Kucukvar, Prof. Dr. Melih Bulu Rector of Istinye University, and Asst. Prof. Dr. Murat Yalçıntaş from the Business Administration Department at Istanbul Ticaret University analyzed the sustainability of urban water system in Istanbul. The researchers developed the first water demand and supply forecasting model for the metropolitan city Istanbul.  </p>
					
					<p>The analysis showed that the residential water consumption is found to be dominant accounting for approximately 80% of city water use. Hence, giving a high priority for reducing household water use and incentives for water efficient household equipment can be listed among the sound water reduction strategies. In addition, the water supply of water in Istanbul is primarily dependent on dams and therefore the amount of water stored in dams will be critical to supply enough water to city. Especially, the fluctuations in stored water in city dams are enormously high which can lead to problematic cases for certain periods. The researchers concluded that it is not sustainable for Istanbul to continue with its current water loss ratio ranging between 35% and 37%. </p>

					<p>The authors also urge that rising investments through mega-projects such as construction of The Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge, The Third Airport with 150 million passenger capacities and The New City Project have a strong potential for increasing the city population as well as demand for clean water in the near future.  </p>

					<h2>5-Vehicle to Grid (V2G) for a Better Market Penetration</h2>

					<p>Electric vehicles can play a key role in the grid's energy balance by serving as a distributed source of stored energy and helping to integrate variable renewable energy sources with the grid, such as wind power and solar power. EVs can also serve as a grid storage tool to meet fluctuating electric power demands through V2G technologies. In a large scale, an organized fleet of EVs can be considered as reliable and flexible power storage for a set of building blocks or grid. In a smaller scale, individual EV owners can use their own vehicles as a source of power alongside with other sources of power through V2H. </p>
					
					<p>Considering the technological and economical challenges (e.g. high initial cost, battery replacement costs) against widespread adoption of EV, areas with potential benefits to EV owners to generate new revenue streams for their businesses can be very important in helping to overcome these barriers. Dr. Onat and his colleagues’ recent work about V2G applications in the US showed that electric vehicles can serve as ancillary service provider, substituting traditional gas turbines, and can generate additional revenue for EV owners, thus increasing EV’s chance to have a greater market penetration. Their results indicate that, for an electric vehicle in the US, the net revenue of V2G services can be up to $42,000 per vehicle on average.  The study showed that individuals is more likely to buy an electric vehicle if their vehicle is integrated to grid, generating additional income for the owners, thus paying back the initial cost as well as the battery replacement costs.
